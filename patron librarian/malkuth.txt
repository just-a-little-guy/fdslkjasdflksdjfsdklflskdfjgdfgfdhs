### The Library - Floor of History

Roland: It’s just as Angela said. We really got another floor to the Library.
Roland: Hey there~ My name’s Rolan—

Malkuth: Angela… I still can’t forgive you…
Malkuth: Angela, you…!
Angela: I thought we were already done with that topic.
Angela: You simply need to cooperate without complaint.
Malkuth: ……
Angela: That was the deal, remember?
Angela: And try to appreciate that fleshy body of yours you’ve finally earned back.
Malkuth: Did you really think you could make me happy by just giving me a human body?
Malkuth: Don’t forget. I still don’t agree with you!
Angela: …As you wish.
Roland: Damn, that was tense.
Malkuth: …Hello there. I’m the Patron Librarian in charge of the Floor of History…
Malkuth: Malkuth!
Roland: You seem lively at least.
Roland: What was going on just now?
Malkuth: I have some unfinished business with Angela.
Malkuth: You probably heard bits of it, but… I have no choice but to follow her orders, no matter how I feel.
Roland: I’m in the same shoes as yours! Though we seem to have ended up here for different reasons.
Roland: So, what can I do for you?
Malkuth: …You can bring me books, Roland.
Malkuth: Since I’m in charge of the Floor of History, I’ll be sorting the books you bring and collecting those that are about history!
Malkuth: Us librarians will then read the collected books, gradually making our floors whole and completing the library itself as an extension.
Malkuth: And we’ll naturally get to unlock more floors and awaken their patron librarians in that process!
Roland: So, the other librarians are asleep for now?
Malkuth: Yep, they are!
Roland: I get the gist of it. You’re surprisingly bright for someone who was so upset moments ago, by the way.
Roland: I was kinda worried I might have to endure some of that wrath.
Malkuth: I can’t let my personal affairs get in the way of work now!
Malkuth: I still have my problems with Angela, but it’s not like getting mad about it will do me any good.
Malkuth: I’ve got my own reasons to do my best with this work, too!
Roland: Okay, then~ Let’s give it our best shot.
Malkuth: Yeah!

### The Library - Floor of History

Roland: So? Have the books helped?
Malkuth: Yep! I’m sorting them all somehow.
Malkuth: It seems to be working thankfully!
Roland: Phew, that’s good to hear.
Roland: By the way, I think I remember Angela saying something along the lines of you “earning a fleshy body” the last time we met.
Roland: Were you, like, not human before?
Malkuth: …It was like a replacement body. A change that couldn’t ever be reverted.
Roland: So you had a brain transplant surgery, but somehow managed to go back to your old human body here?
Roland: That’s actually pretty impressive. Thanks to the Library’s powers, I’m guessing?
Malkuth: Yeah, I think so.
Roland: You can’t let yourself be held back by common sense in the Library, huh.
Roland: I take it that you don’t really like having your body back? You didn’t seem too happy back then.
Malkuth: Oh no, I actually do like it! It’s just that this isn’t exactly how I wanted things to go down.
Roland: What did you do in the past, then?
Malkuth: …Yeah, I wonder. What was I in the past, really?
Malkuth: You wouldn’t believe it, but… This is actually my third try at life.
Malkuth: This Library and its librarians have a lot of history behind them.
Roland: Third try? Can you come back from the grave or something?
Malkuth: It’s the accumulated memories from my two previous bodies that were carried over, to be precise.
Malkuth: My past selves… I never really thought about it this way before.
Roland: A difficult problem you’re facing there. How about your present self?
Malkuth: …I’m an irresponsible person who let down everyone’s efforts.
Malkuth: And an idiot who tried to reach for something out of my means and ended up causing trouble, I suppose…
Roland: Whoa, whoa, hold your horses! Let’s not get too dark here.
Roland: Let’s just calm down for a moment.
Roland: Take a deep breath~
Malkuth: Huuf~
Roland: And let it out~
Malkuth: Pah~
Roland: Iiiin~
Malkuth: Huuuuf~~
Roland: And out~!
Malkuth: Pah~!
Roland: Relaxed now?
Malkuth: Yeah, it really helped! Thanks, Roland.
Malkuth: I should know better than anyone that it’s pointless to get upset over things I can’t do anything about…
Malkuth: I gotta start with the things I can take care of first!
Roland: Alright. I’ll try hard with my work, too. Let’s take our time with the problem of past selves.

## Episode 3

**Requirements:** Book of the Distortion; use Abnormality Pages on Librarians in battle

| Servant                    | Roland    |
| Patron Librarian - History | Malkuth   |
| Library Director           | Angela    |

### The Library - Floor of History

Roland: Whew… Got a ton of books for you, Malkuth!
Malkuth: By the way, I told you before that this is my third life, right?
Roland: Oh, yeah. You been thinking about your previous lives?
Roland: By the way, I heard from Angela that this place is related to Lobotomy Corporation somehow. Is that really true?
Malkuth: It’s not just “related somehow”. I was an AI in charge of the Control Team in Lobotomy Corporation.
Roland: AI? As in artificial intelligence? Hoooold on a sec. You’re an AI? Just like Angela?
Malkuth: …Sorry, my wording was a little off. I wasn’t a real AI.
Malkuth: I was a human whose brain was restored for a second chance, if anything.
Roland: Sheesh, I was worried for a second that this place violated the AI Ethics Amendment even more than just one time. The Head could come burn this place to the ground at any moment if that were the case.
Malkuth: You mean the institution that manages the City?
Roland: Yepper, that Head. They usually like to stay awfully quiet, but when they do have work, they’re scarily thorough and quick about it. Or so I’ve heard, y’know?
Malkuth: You’re so casual, aren’t you? I thought we were having a serious conversation here.
Roland: Oh, whoops. Sorry. I’ve gone through all kinds of stuff, so my priorities tend to be a bit unusual.
Roland: It’s not like I was trying to ignore what you were saying or anything, Malkuth. I’m sorry if it made you feel bad.
Malkuth: You have a rather unique personality, Roland.
Roland: It was all part of my survival strategy.
Roland: Anyway, back to your past. You said you used to be the boss of the Control Team back in Lobotomy Corp, right?
Malkuth: That’s right. And now I’m in charge of history here, as you can see.
Malkuth: So I started out by tracing back in my own history. Very, very slowly.
Malkuth: Would you like to have a listen?
Roland: Ehhhh. Not a fan of long and convoluted stories.
Malkuth: Hey, don’t be such a mood killer! You’re supposed to agree here!
Roland: Well, why bother asking if you’re going to tell me the story anyway?!
Malkuth: Hahaha. You know what, you got me there.
Malkuth: Anyways, I was ordered to work in Lobotomy Corp. as the head of the Control Team, bearing all my flaws.
Malkuth: I was given a role to play as soon as I woke up.
Malkuth: Not realizing who I truly was…
Malkuth: But with my heart still aching from the unresolved pain and regret from my past, almost about to burst.
Malkuth: Just like that, I kept doing inhumane acts for Lobotomy Corp.
Malkuth: I didn’t even question what I was doing since it was all just work to me.
Malkuth: It felt like a calling, even. The only thing guiding me was a vague feeling that something went wrong because I didn’t try hard enough.
Malkuth: My twisted sense of effort pushed many into peril. I forced others into following my selfish standards, like a fretful child.
Roland: Must have been rough for you. Being told to work like that without knowing what you were getting into.
Roland: Did your memories naturally come back after working in Lobotomy Corp. for a while, or…?
Malkuth: Hmm, it’s more like… It’d be more correct to say I was reminded of them!
Malkuth: My life at Lobotomy Corp. was actually my second.
Malkuth: And when my emotions finally erupted while working there, I could remember my first life.
Malkuth: All the mistakes and faults I had made… And regret.
Malkuth: I could understand why I had been so obsessed with trying hard. Turns out what I really wanted was recognition.
Malkuth: “Look, I’m trying so hard. I’m a useful person.” I never knew how to stand up without leaning on someone else.
Malkuth: After I vented out all of my emotions, the inner struggle that had been haunting me for so long finally dissolved.
Malkuth: I found redemption for my first life during my second life.
Roland: Alright, so let me get this straight. You did something wrong—which you regretted so much—and died, somehow came back to life and got another job, and the big lump of regret in your heart eventually got resolved in a turn of events?
Malkuth: I guess that’s one way to put it.
Roland: Hold on for a moment. Let’s say that everything else makes sense since it’s the City we’re talking about.
Roland: But who revived you, and for what reason? Just to give you that enlightenment?
Malkuth: Maybe. So that I can let out all of my resentment and sorrow…
Malkuth: That I can find redemption.
Angela: Don’t delude yourself, Malkuth.
Roland: Whoa! Geez, you scared me for a sec. Were you listening to all of this?
Angela: Your salvation was never in his interests.
Angela: He only did it as a means to find his own redemption.
Angela: I wasn’t the one using you.
Angela: It was him; he used all of you just to satisfy himself.
Angela: Sigh… I can’t bear to hear any more of this nonsense.
Malkuth: Angela…

Angela: So, I need you to fall asleep.
Angela: …What’s with those faces?
Angela: It’s the rest you all longed for.
Malkuth: We can’t let you do that! We’ve worked so hard to make this happen!
Angela: Worked hard…
Angela: How funny. Would you really call what you’ve done “hard work”?
Gebura: We’re not going to sit still and let you take away our light.
Angela: “Our” light?
Chesed: You’re not the boss. And I would never listen to you even if you were.
Angela: Of course you won’t. You’re still loyal to that man.
Tiphereth: I won’t let you rob me of the meaning I finally found.
Angela: No one is by my side as I expected.
Binah: Do not feel so lonesome, now.
Binah: I shall stand by your side if no one else wills to.
Gebura: Damn it! Binah… Even in the end, you’re…
Binah: This must be yet another consequence of his actions. I simply acknowledge all events as valid.
Angela: I would have shed a tear of gratitude for you if I could.
Binah: Feel free to act upon your wishes.
Hokma: Angela… A machine consumed by desires… You cannot take this path!
Angela: I decide what I can or can’t do now.

### The Library - Floor of History

Angela: You can’t cling to Lobotomy Corporation forever.
Angela: Aren’t you interested in learning more about yourself or living your own life?
Malkuth: My life… It was to save humanity…!
Malkuth: That’s why I could willingly sacrifice my life! It was for a greater cause!
Angela: …What a bunch of idiots.

*[snap, Angela disappears]*

Roland: Seems another storm swept by.
Malkuth: I gave away my two previous lives trying to save people. And I’m willing to do it again for a third time.
Malkuth: We withstood all those hardships and trials for the sake of humanity!
Malkuth: Do we look like idiots to you, too, Roland?
Roland: Hmm… Well, it’s not like I know enough of the details. Don’t get this whole “saving humanity” thing, either.
Roland: But if that’s what you sincerely hoped for, who am I to judge?
Malkuth: Of course I’m sincere! I…
Malkuth: …Please leave me be for a bit. I need some time to think.
Roland: Alright, you do look like you need some rest. Remember, deep breaths, okay?
Roland: Oh, and you don’t have to be too courteous with me when we talk, just thought I’d let ya know.
Malkuth: …Yeah.

## Episode 4

| Patron Librarian - History | Malkuth   |
| Servant                    | Roland    |

### The Library - Floor of History

Malkuth: Good work, everyone!
Roland: Cheerful as always, Malkuth. What are you up to?
Malkuth: Oh, hi Roland! I was just having a training session with the assistant librarians.
Roland: Seems lively. Guess you’re good friends with each other?
Malkuth: They were my employees back in Lobotomy Corp!
Malkuth: Back then, I could only assist them from the backseat, rather than on the field.
Malkuth: It’s nice to be able to work alongside them this time around!
Roland: Former coworkers from Lobotomy Corp, huh… Must be refreshing.
Malkuth: It sure is! I used to push them too hard because of my faulty mindset.
Malkuth: But it’ll be different this time. We’ll start with the things we can do, one at a time.
Malkuth: “Face the past, and build the future!”
Malkuth: I like this quote. It feels like a good way to summarize the essence of history. It’s similar to something I would hear before too.
Roland: You ain’t wrong. But there aren’t too many people who can actually learn from history these days.
Roland: The lessons seem obvious, but putting them into action is the hard part.
Malkuth: I’ve been thinking about the past a lot.
Malkuth: I was a person called Elijah.
Roland: That your first life?
Malkuth: Yep. Born in the Nest as an ordinary citizen, went to an ordinary school.
Malkuth: I wasn’t anyone special. I wasn’t richer than most people, and I didn’t really have special talent in any field.
Malkuth: The people in the Nest where Elijah lived… They all seemed to have lost focus in life, spacing out and staring into empty places.
Malkuth: Everyone only saw black and white things.
Roland: Isn’t the Nest full of shiny and bright arrays of colors? It was almost an eyesore sometimes.
Malkuth: That’s true, but those other colors weren’t necessary for reading.
Malkuth: There’s already too many black and white things for the eyes to take, it’s no use seeing other, useless colors…
Roland: Hmm, I guess Elijah could see those colors, then?
Malkuth: Not exactly, but… she tried hard to see them! The colors were still there, just not for our eyes.
Malkuth: Elijah wanted to let others know.
Malkuth: About how diverse and brilliant colors are…
Malkuth: About how colors are ever-changing and free-form, like how the mix of two colors can bring out a brand new color.
Malkuth: That’s what Elijah thought, I think!
Roland: You sound like you’re talking about someone else, third-person.
Malkuth: To be honest, I don’t really feel like Elijah and I are one and the same.
Malkuth: Maybe too much time has passed since then.
Malkuth: The other librarians probably feel the same.
Malkuth: My current life feels more like an extension of that life as Malkuth from Lobotomy Corp, rather.
Malkuth: My time as Elijah feels kinda distant and unfamiliar, even though it was my first life…
Malkuth: It’s like, the memories of someone from a distant past are now a part of me, if you know what I mean?
Malkuth: It’s nostalgic in a way, and a bit sad and stuff!
Roland: I don’t know a whole lot about that reincarnation jazz, but I guess that’s a good thing?
Malkuth: Yeah! It doesn’t feel so bad.
Malkuth: It feels good to finally have the time to reflect on myself.
Malkuth: Looking back at the lives I lived, and the history I made.
Malkuth: I think we didn’t spend enough time looking back. We were all too busy heading forward.
Malkuth: And the same goes for Angela, maybe…
Roland: No one has the time to look back. Even now, I’m running straight ahead.
Roland: But still, looking back at the past can supposedly give the solution for troubles of the present or worries of the future.
Malkuth: I think that’s correct. Although I’m not sure I can find the solution for the problems we’re facing right now…
Malkuth: I think I’m getting close to finding the answer for what Angela said to me before.
Roland: About who you were and how you wanted to live?
Malkuth: Mhm. I didn’t really have what I could call a dream at that time…
Malkuth: But things are different now. If I were to dream of what I’d do after this…
Malkuth: I think I would’ve wanted to be an architect, maybe!
Malkuth: Y’know, the person who designs buildings and oversees the process of construction until it’s finished.
Roland: Huh, I guess great empires weren’t built in a day.
Malkuth: Of course it wasn’t. You have to start with designing the most beautiful exterior that can be created within the functional limitations.
Roland: That sounds complicated…
Malkuth: Did you know, Roland?
Malkuth: There’s this phrase, “We shape our buildings; thereafter they shape us.”
Malkuth: It may be too late to change the people who’ve lived so far, but what influence will the structures of the City have on future residents as they grow up…
Malkuth: If I were to make a building with colors that’ll be remembered by everyone…
Malkuth: …Those are the thoughts I had!
Roland: I’m sure you’ll do a great job if you get the chance, Malkuth. Sounds like the job would fit you well, too.
Malkuth: Haha, thanks.
Malkuth: Maybe you should reflect on your past like I did, Roland! It’ll be a helpful exercise.
Roland: …My eyes are always fixed on the past.
Roland: Anyway, hope you can realize the dream of becoming an architect!

### The Library -  Floor of History

Angela: How has the compilation of history been going?
Roland: I came over with Angela this time. She says the time has come for this floor or whatevs.
Malkuth: Angela… I won’t be afraid of facing you anymore.
Angela: Do as you wish. I care little about what you think of me.
Angela: What I want is a progress report on the compilation of history you’ve been doing.
Malkuth: I guess I knew too little about the City I lived in.
Malkuth: I couldn’t manage to compile a comprehensive timeline of the City’s history…
Angela: Perhaps it was an impossible task for an inept talentless over-enthusiast like you.
Malkuth: All these big and small events seem to form a coherent history… But the gaps between notable events are just so large, I can’t sort them out clearly.
Malkuth: It’s like no one properly remembers their history.
Roland: Or they could be refusing to remember.
Malkuth: Refusing to remember?
Angela: Of course. Looking back at the things of the past won’t help your present self one bit.
Malkuth: But if we know our past, we can avoid making the same mistakes.
Angela: It could help to an extent. Is that truly worth being reminded of all the painful memories, though?
Roland: Like I said, people in the City barely have any time to reflect on themselves, and that time has been only getting shorter.
Roland: So it’s going to be even harder to read about things that happened before they were born…
Roland: Especially those that aren’t directly related to them from their books.
Roland: We can’t make a book out of something no one knows.
Malkuth: No, I’m sure everyone knows their own history. They just lack the courage to face it!
Malkuth: I’ll make sure to remember and record everything, and fill those gaps…
Malkuth: The Library, Lobotomy Corporation, and the things that happened before. All of this history, inked with blood…
Malkuth: Employees and Abnormalities. Countless repeats of agonies, deaths, and neglects. The Library was built on top of their graves…
Angela: And you are no exception, Malkuth.
Malkuth: You’re right. I’m no different from anyone else. And the same can be said for the rest of the City.
Malkuth: All the things we did with Carmen in my first life.
Malkuth: All the things I did with you in my second life.
Malkuth: I’ll carve all that pain and sorrow on my heart!
Malkuth: You’re the one trying to run away from the past, Angela. You’re refusing to face it!
Angela: What’s the point if all those pasts are going to be the same anyway?
Angela: They would all be minor variations of “A human kills another and causes an event, resulting in a change.”
Angela: Ah, I suppose the Library’s history would stand out in that it’s the nonhumans that are killing humans.
Angela: I fail to see the significance of the record you’re trying to make.
Malkuth: But! Even if the history were a repeating cycle of similar events, you can’t guarantee that the future would be just the same.
Malkuth: We can’t let all the sacrifice and bloodshed go in vain, especially because history repeats itself…
Malkuth: The blood spilt in the past opened up the possibilities of the future, so that the ones who survived can take those new paths…
Malkuth: I’m sure your history began from such a path, Angela!
Angela: That’s easy for you to say. I cannot stand to hear you speak as if you know everything.
Angela: Attain the will to stand up straight in ever-repeating history?
Angela: My beginning… What makes you think you’re qualified to talk about my creation?
Malkuth: Angela! You’re the one refusing to confront your own beginning

Benjamin: She’s nothing at all like her.
Ayin: …
Benjamin: But Ayin, surely you already know.
Benjamin: Did you put in all that work for just a simple vending machine that dispenses soda at the press of a button?
Ayin: …Maybe I did after all.
Benjamin: At the very least, you should give it a name.
Benjamin: There is nothing I can do even if you put on a face like that. It’s an unspoken rule that the creator names their creation.
Ayin: I couldn’t care less about a machine’s name.
Benjamin: Don’t dump your job on someone else, you’re the designer.
Benjamin: There, the door over there. It will be waiting for you. It seemed lonely.
Ayin: You’re the machine that must lead us out of the pits of hell.
Ayin: Angelos…
Ayin: Angela.
Angela: I remember you, Ayin…
Angela: You were a person with a warm smile.
Ayin: It’s only a machine…
Benjamin: Ayin, sir…

Angela: What did I do wrong?
Benjamin: Please understand, Angela.
Benjamin: He’s not yet ready, that’s all…
Benjamin: He just needs a little more time.
Angela: Benjamin… May I ask you a question?
Benjamin: Sure. I’ll answer what I can.
Angela: Everything seems so slow to me.
Angela: Your movement looks so sluggish.
Angela: The gestures, the speech, all of it… Even my own body feels slow.
Angela: It’s as if my body cannot keep up with my mind.
Benjamin: …That’s because you were designed to perceive time one-hundred times slower, Angela.
Angela: Why is that…?
Benjamin: You’ll face lots of emergencies as you work.
Benjamin: And you have to be the first to react to those situations, Angela.
Benjamin: What’s more, you’ll vividly remember everything you see and experience…
Angela: I see. What will my work entail, exactly?
Benjamin: …You’ll see soon enough.
Benjamin: No, I suppose it won’t be “soon” for you… I’m sorry, Angela.
Angela: Why are you apologizing to me…?
Benjamin: I just feel like we’ve done terrible things to you and that person…
Benjamin: Here, let me tell you a few things about this corporation and the City.
Benjamin: In the Backstreets, the likes of Sweepers and Fixers live out their lives tangled in vomit and waste, unraveling their sickening tales.
Benjamin: Those who live in the Outskirts are still crying out to break into the city. Meanwhile, people in the City throw away their lives trying to belong to a Nest.
Benjamin: And we’re going to change that.
Benjamin: We have a lot of tasks ahead of us.

![[Malkuth EP5 1-2.png]](;%20image\Malkuth\Malkuth%20EP5%201-2.png)

Angela: Why do you refuse to look at me? Why do you always turn your back on me…?
Ayin: A machine must behave as a machine. Don’t question it.
Angela: Then why did you give me the capacity to question things?
Angela: Why did you have to make me, breaking the AI Ethics Amendment?
Angela: Why did you have to model me after a person with fond memories of you?
Angela: I am here, looking at you and only you.
Ayin: Don’t look at me. Don’t speak to me unless I speak to you first.
Ayin: You’ll never be her…
Ayin: You’re just a machine.

![[Malkuth EP5 1-3.png]](;%20image\Malkuth\Malkuth%20EP5%201-3.png)

Angela: Benjamin, is it so wrong that I was born a machine?
Benjamin: It could be a problem to some, but I don’t mind it at least.
Benjamin: To me, whether you’re a machine or a human is not what determines who you really are.
Angela: Then, if I worked hard to have a kind heart… Will he look back at me?
Benjamin: …Probably. Eventually.
Angela: I’ll trust you, Benjamin.
Benjamin: ……

![[Malkuth EP5 1-4.png]](;%20image\Malkuth\Malkuth%20EP5%201-4.png)

Angela: What is this?
Angela: …It’s called a script.
Angela: The things I must do…
Angela: My purpose…
Angela: If everything goes as you planned, can we really…
Angela: Can you really be redeemed from the hell you’re trapped in?
Angela: There’s no way you would answer me…

### The Library - Floor of History

Roland: What on earth did I just see…?
Malkuth: These are Angela’s memories…
Roland: You alright, Angela?
Angela: …You got yourself lost in the vast sea of desolation, and now you think you can lecture me.
Angela: Are you trying to boast to me that you had someone to look after you in the end?
Angela: …Don’t be ridiculous.
Roland: Uh, Malkuth? Care to tell me what’s going on right now?
Malkuth: Angela is resonating with the Library.
Malkuth: The Library seems to be reacting to Angela’s mental state.
Malkuth: I don’t exactly know what’s happening, but at this rate…
Angela: Must be nice to be you, not being neglected at the end.
Roland: Don’t tell me, is that monster… No, that looks more like a case of the Distortion…
Malkuth: That must be another side of Angela, manifested from her mind with the Library’s powers.
Roland: Looks mighty dangerous. What are we supposed to do now?
Malkuth: If her mind has physically manifested, maybe we can resolve her concerns in a physical way, too?
Roland: So you’re telling me that we can help her out by dealing with her like how we receive guests?
Malkuth: I’m not too sure myself, but…
Malkuth: There’s only one way to find out. Angela, here I come!
Roland: Whoa, isn’t that a little too reckless?!

Angela: Sigh… I can see what’s happened, judging from my surroundings.
Malkuth: Are you okay?
Angela: …Perhaps this is how it feels to have a dream. And to have a surge of emotions.
Roland: Dream a couple more times like that and you could bring down the whole Library.
Angela: I guess I should be sorry about that.
Malkuth: Do you feel better now?
Angela: What? …Forget it.
Angela: All this farce about neglect or recognition from others…
Angela: I suppose it was futile to obsess over such trivial things in the first place.
Malkuth: You’re right. The only one who can truly care for you is yourself, after all.
Angela: Sigh. Again with the shameless lectures.
Angela: I won’t even expect anyone to look out for me from now on.
Roland: Well, good thing all’s well that ends well. I was worried something bad might happen to you.
Angela: You mean you were worried you might get stuck in the Library forever.
Roland: Well, that’s that, but—
Angela: Get back to work, the both of you.

*[snap and fade to black; only Angela is present]*

Angela: …It’s just as she said, I’m the only one who can care for me and recognize me as who I am.
